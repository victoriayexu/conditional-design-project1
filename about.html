            <br />
            A starter phrase by my own creation was fed into a GPT-2 text
            generator. I broke up the text into reasonably-sized clauses and fed
            each snippet into AttnGAN, an environmental image generator, one at
            a time. I then ran each generated image into a GAN image identifier,
            trained to identify spaces. As a final experiment, I put the entire
            text written by the GPT-2 generator into AttnGAN, creating the image
            you see below.

              The motions of the body of the cosmos are among them, for which
              they are present as the debris of all eternity. The universe is a
              benign sphere of direct and invisible force. That, in the visible
              world, is the true force of nature.
